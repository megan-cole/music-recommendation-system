# Music Recommendation System
A recommendation system is a system that uses data science
algorithms and techniques in order to suggest items a user may like based on content they already know they like. There are two main recommendation processes: content-based and collaborative systems. 
Content-based recommendation systems recommend items based on their similarity with other items in the dataset.
Collaborative based recommendation systems recommend items based on what items other users with similar tastes enjoy. 

## About The Project
This repository contains my implementation of a Music Recommendation System in order to recommend songs to users
based on their favorite songs. I chose to implement a hybrid recommendation system in order to recommend the 10 most similar songs to a song or playlist a user enjoys. I used a dataset from Kaggle that contains 600K+ tracks extracted from the spotify API from 1920-2020. I used the Spotify API in order to extract information for the user's entries, as well as songs from 2020-2024 to keep my data up to date.
